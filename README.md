# 3D_Gaussian_Splatting--2D_to_3D_Image_Reconstruction
3D Gaussian Splatting â€“ 2D to 3D Reconstruction uses anisotropic Gaussians to transform multi-view 2D images into detailed 3D scenes. By adaptively densifying point clouds and optimizing spherical harmonic color rendering, it achieves high-fidelity, real-time results for AR/VR, robotics, and immersive applications.

HERE ARE THE RESULTS OF INITIAL MAPPING OF POINTS AND AFTER THE TRAINING!
